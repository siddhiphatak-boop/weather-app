# weather-app
A responsive Weather App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
This is a simple and responsive Weather Application that allows users to search for any city and get real-time weather details including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

The application uses the Fetch API with async/await to retrieve live data from the OpenWeatherMap API and dynamically updates the UI using JavaScript DOM manipulation.

It also includes basic error handling for invalid city names and condition-based weather icons.
